AINSWORTH’S LATIN DICTIONARY. 8v0,

1028 pp.

This work is so well known as hardly to need a notice. Its
almost universal use in the schools and colleges of this country,
as well as in those of England‚ is an evidence of its superiority
over other works of the kind. It is now offered at a price much
lower than formerly, while it is manufactured in a superior man·

This work contains about the same number of words as the
larger work, the chief abridgment being in the quotations and

illustratione of the original work. From the convenience of its ·
, size and cheapness‚ it is particularly adapted for the use of be-

ginners.

This is a very great aid to the Latin scholar, and is almost
indispensable to the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of
