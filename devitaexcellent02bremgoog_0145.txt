THEMISTOCLES. 135

traciam. There was at Athens, near the market, a place senced
in with rails, into which any citizen might throw a shall or tile,
on which he had written the name of any great man whom he
wished to have bamshed. At stated periods, these were counted
by the archons3 and if they exceeded 6,000, the person whose
name was found on the majority was banished for ten
years. His property, however, was not confiscated3 hut was
preserved for him till his return. Some say that the names
were written on shclls ,· and others, on tiles, or pieces of broken
earthen ware: and the latter is the more probable, as the word
suffragium, derived from sub andfrangcrc, means a small frag·
ment,· and was probably adopted to signify a vote, because
votes were written on such pieces.—Argos.· not the accusa-
tive plural, but the singular of the third declension, neuter
gender: Argos, gen. Argeos or Argis, as in line 13, below. Greek
nouus of the third declension will be often met with in this work.

11. Crimine: ‘accusation or indictment.’

18. Qud ...... tueretur. Construction: [ut] tueretur sc receptum
quc) [eo] majore religione. See note to p. 4,1. 13, (2).-Rel2·-
gione: this word is used by Nepos to signify good saith, reli-
gious obligatiom—-Tueretur .- the primitive signification of this
word is to look upon, to see, to fix tlte eye upon ,⁰ and therefore
its derivative, tutus, meant a thing that was seen, a thing under
the eye, and therefore safc .· and hence tueor came to signify to
look after the safcty of a thing, to watclz over, to provide, to
make sure; and may be rendered by one of these above, or by
ecc, which is often us'ed in this sense.

22. Quam prestitit .· ‘ which he made good, performed, fulfilled.’

24. Prodidit. Not betrayed, but ‘gave up.’-—Ut consuleret
sibi .- ‘ that he should take care for himself!

26. Quod. See note top. 9‚1.19. Proesidii refers to the
means of subsistence.

27. In navem ascendit .· ‘ embarked on board a ship.'

30. Sibi esse pereundum. Gr. R. XXXII. No. 1.

33. Diem noctemque: ‘ a day and a nightss or ‘ day and night.'
The former is the more probable3 since, in the latter sense, the
plural is more common.

1. In salo. Salum means, not the high sea, the decp; but 15
what may be nearly equivalent to soundings ,⁰ and therefore ⁴
the ship might 'm *n ancoris, and yet be procul ab insula.
