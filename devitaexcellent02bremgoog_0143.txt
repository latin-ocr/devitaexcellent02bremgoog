THEMISTOCLES. 133

23. Bellum coelectorum .- i. e. eum confecturum esse bellum.

25. Εὸ valebat.- ‘ so far succeeded.‘

26. Subesse .· ‘ was concealed.’

32. Hic: i. e. ‘ Barbarus,’ namely, Xerxes.

33. opprimere .· ‘ to crush, ruin, overthrow, destroy.‘

l. Gradu depulsus est. The phrase is borrowed from the glad· 12
iators. Gradus is the position claosen. De gradu dejici, ‘ to be
thrown down from the position 3’ de gradu depelli, ‘ to be driven
from the position! Eodem refers to Themistocles.

2. Certiorem eum fecit. This means more than merely to
inform, or apprize3 as it implies that pains were taken to do it3 ·
and may be rendered, sent him word or assured him. It is osten
used of one's self: certiorem se fecit, ‘ took paine to ascertain.'

3. Id agi .- ‘ that it was in agitation,‘ ‘ that exertions were mak-
ing.’ This isa peculiar phrase: the pronoun id has no antece
dent, but refers to the following clause3 being used superfluously,
and always followed by ut with the subjunctive, where the pro-
noun itself would be omitted in English, with the following verb
in the infinitive. The above sentence literally is, ‘ that this was
in agitation, namely, that the bridge might be destroyed τ’ whereas
in English we should say, ‘that it was in agitation to destroy
the bridge.'

5. quue ei persuasit .- ‘ and he made him believe it.’

12. Post hominum memoriam. This clause qualifies onesimo .·
‘ tlte greatest fleet, since the memory of man.‘

14. Quum ...... uterentur. ‘ For since the Phalerean port, which
the Atheniens made use of, was neither large nor good? See
note to p. 10, l. 21. Many such simple sentences occur, which
can be rendered into good English only by being considered as
compound ; that is, by being made into two ,· supplying the rela-
tive in the first, and some form of the verb to be in the
second.

19. Praecipuo periculo suo : ‘ at his own particular peril.‘

21. Negarem oportere, διο. Here, ‘ to deny that it is neces·
sary to have a thing-,⁹ is used for ‘ to affirm that it was necessary
not to have it! To deny is to affirm the negative ; and the neg-
ative part of negarent should here be transferred to haberi, or to
ullam; thus, ‘they might affirm or maintain that it was neces,-
sary that any city should not be had, i. e. that no city should ’
be had, beyond the Peloponnesus.' A similar expression occurs
