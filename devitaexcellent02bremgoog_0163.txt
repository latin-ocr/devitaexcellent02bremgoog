pointment to office. 11. An achievement which gains him pro·
motion: He takes Thyus, his cousin, a revolted governor of
Paphlagonia. ΙΙΙ. His despatch; and the ludicrous presentation
of his prisoner to the king of Persia: He is richly rewarded,
and placed at the head of an expedition against Egypt. lv.
While deeply engaged in preparations, the king sends him to
take Aspis, governor of Cataonia: His unexampled despatch,
and success: He sends his prisoner to the king. V. Artaxerxes’
messenger, sent to countermand the former order, meets the
prisoner: Datames' promptness gains him the favor of all,
except the officers; who, out of envy, conspire to ruin him:
By the advice of PandateS, he quits the king’s interest, and
retires to Cappadocia. V1. The Pisidians raise an army against
him, and Mithrobarzanes deserting him, his prompt stratagem
against the enemy, and its success. vn. His son deserts him,
and informs the king5 who sends Autophradaten to take him:
He takes refuge, with his adherents, in the passes of the moun·
taine. VIII. Immense armament sent against him: They attack
him on unfavorable ground, and are defeated with great loss:
Wearied by the many engagements‚ in which Datames is always
superior, Autophradates endeavors to win him over to the
king's favor. IX. Fired with an implacable hatred against
him, the king tries to destroy him by stratagem3 which he
sometimes escapes‚ and sometimes defeats by a counter strata·
gem. X., XI. The deep—laid plot of Mithrobarzanes against
him by pretending friendship ; which succeeds, and he assassinates
Datames with his own hand.
