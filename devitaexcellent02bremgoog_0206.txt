a reading book in 80110018, unsurpassed in every particular that ’

18 8888111181 10 811011 8 1188. To 11118, 110818 of teachers who have
used it. and now use it set their 88818. Itis extensively used in
the public and private schools of Philadelphia‚ as well as in
those of different sections of the country. The following notice
from individuale of high character as 188011818, 18 8 high recom-
mendation :—

We, the subscribere, teachers, have examined‚ with close at·
tention, the story of “Jack Halyard,'' and feel 8 pleasure in
acknowledging 0111· obligations to the author of this interesting
work. For the purposes designed, this publication is not, in our
opinion, surpassed by any one that has fallen under our notice.

As a work of fiction, probably no other possesses 80 much of
the excellence of truth. The characters are portrayed with a
master-hand, and, what greatly enhances its practical valne,
their merit is of the imitable kind. The manner in which 11
fastens 011 1118 minds of the young, the varied instruction it con-
veys, and the love of virtue which it 18 calculated to inspire,
with the beautiful simplicit-y of the style in which 118 senti·
ments are expressed, render it a work of superior excellence as
a class-book in 80110018.
