JAOOB’S LATIN READER, First Part, with a

vocabulary and English noteS, for the use of schools and aca-
demies. Edited by Gnoson Bimcnorr. . . 50 cents.

Editor-’s Advercisement. In preparing the second edition of J a·
cob’s Latin Reader, the work has undergone a thorough revision 3
notes have been added, and many words, which had been omitted
in the dictionary, are here inserted in their respective places.
The editor, in publishing this work in America, was influenccd
by a belief, that it forms an easy introduction to the language
and character of the Roman world. He selected it as the best
from many similar works, and is happy in finding his judgment

confirmed by that of many instructore.
Gnoson BAncnor'r.

Jacob's Latin Reader is a standard work, and the fact that
almost every new Latin Reader that has been issued since its
publication has been but an adaptation of the editor’s notes or
whims to J acob’s- text, proves it to be a super-excellent book.

. We believe no Latin Reader, but that of Jacob under some one

or other of its various modifications, is used in the schools of this
country. 12m0‚ 259 pp.

CORNELIUS NEPOS, for the use of classicaI
schools and academies. 12m0‚ 192 pp. . . 60 cents.

This is a very neat edition of this author, being beautifully
printed and well bound. It should be oue of the first reading
books of all classical studente.

“Cornelius Nepos is, more than any other Roman writer,
suited to be put i'nto the hands of boys, who have made sufficient
progress to be able to read a Roman author in course. The sim-
plicity and classical character ot' his style; the separate lives,
full of interest, and not long enough to weary; the extent of
history, ot' which he gives a plcasing outline, by presenting, as
in a gallery, those illustrious men who direct-ed the fortunes of
antiquity3 the general purity of the moral tendencies -of his
writingS, and the favourable moral influence which always fol-
lows from the true history of great men, are circumstances which
explain why he is so universally adopted in the European
schools, and is beginning to be introduced iu so many of our
own.”
