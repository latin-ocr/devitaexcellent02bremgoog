Roma, Rome, a celebrated city
of Italy on the Tiber, 1ss miles
frorn its mouth. It was founded
by Romulus, B. C. 753, and at
first consisted of a small castle
on the Palatine hill, held by a
few lawless warriors. For 244
years it was governed by king's,
and was greatly increased y
the conquest of the neighboring
tribes. The last of the kings
was expelled by Brutus, Β. C.
509, and Rome was governed by
consuls for 478 years, till the bat-
tle of Actium, B. C. 31. Con-
tinuing to increase from the causes
above named, she had already
become mistress of Italy, when
B. C. 264, she became involved

20 years had elapsed, and Han-
nibal [2d Punic war] marched
above 100‚000 men across the
Pyrenees and the Alps into Ital ,
where he was almost invariabfy
victorious, and kept the Romans
in terror for 16 years3 till, in·
structed b his example, they
fitted out cipio with a large arm-
ament to carry the war to Car·
thage. Hannibal was recalled,
met the enemy at Zama, and
though the Carthaginians fought
with the most obstinate courage,

yet their cause was totally rum-
ed, B. C. ⁶202. In the tlce'rd Pu-

Carthage level with the ground,

vigorously prosecuted her con-
quests, and at length the Jugur·

prey to civil factivus. These
were two restless spirits, neither
of whom could bear a rival3 and
though they fought the battles

their country, yet they most in-

divided the empire among thern,
and each retired to administer his
government: but Crassus was
illed in Asia3 and Caesar, who
had received Gaul, soon finding
cause for quarrel with Pompey,
entered Italy sword in hand: the
latter fleeing, he pursued him
into Greece ; and at the battle of
Pharsalia in Thessaly, Pompe
was totally defeated, fled for li e
